type make to compile
to run execute ./oss optional flags include [nsbi]


Currently the timer isn't working correctly even though i have confirmed that multiple different thrreads are running, just wasn't getting timer
the output also isn't correct when doing process handling



make clean will remove all executables along with .o files and .output files
